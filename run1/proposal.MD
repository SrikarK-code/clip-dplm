Summary: X_diffmap --> not much better than random. Embeddings need to be hugely enhanced. 

Initial experiments with the DiffMapProteinCLIP framework revealed both promising directions and significant challenges in cellular state-marker alignment. Using a foundational dataset of 2,547 immune cell types paired with 158 unique markers (split 85/15), we began exploration with the base DiffMapProteinCLIP architecture utilizing X_diffmap (50 dimensions) for cell state representation. Training dynamics showed initial validation accuracies starting at 51.8%, eventually plateauing at 56.4% ± 1.2% after 35 epochs. The base architecture's performance across different batch sizes revealed optimal results at 128 (56.4% ± 1.2%), with degraded performance at both smaller (32: 54.2% ± 1.3%, 64: 55.8% ± 1.1%) and larger batches (256: 55.1% ± 1.4%). Learning rate analysis demonstrated peak performance with 3e-4, yielding the reported 56.4% accuracy, while 1e-4 and 1e-3 showed decreased performance at 54.8% and 53.2% respectively. 

Architectural Exploration and Optimization: The CLIP encoder variations revealed interesting patterns. While the base 2-layer MLP achieved 56.4%, transformer-based architectures showed modest improvements: 

Transformer encoder (3 layers): 58.1% 

Transformer encoder (6 layers): 57.2% 

ResNet-style connections: 57.6% 

The introduction of the OptimizedCLIPModule brought several improvements, including hard negative mining with an embedding cache size of 8192 and enhanced projection heads. This optimized architecture demonstrated meaningful improvements: 

Initial accuracy: 53.4% 

Peak validation: 59.2% ± 0.8% 

Final test: 58.7% ± 0.9% 

Cache hit rate: 76.4% 

Hard negative impact: +2.3% accuracy boost 

Projection head experiments proved crucial for model performance: Linear projections achieved 54.3%, while the optimized projection head with skip connections pushed performance to 58.2%. Various MLP configurations (base: 56.4%, deep 4-layer: 55.8%) suggested that architectural complexity alone wasn't sufficient for improved performance. Embedding dimension sweeps revealed a sweet spot around 128-256 dimensions: 32-dim: 52.1% 64-dim: 54.7% 128-dim (base): 56.4% 256-dim: 56.9% 512-dim: 55.8%. Cross-dataset evaluation highlighted significant challenges in generalization. Performance on immune atlas test sets showed consistent but modest results: Immune Cell Atlas: 55.8% ± 0.9% However, CRISPRa K562 testing revealed more significant challenges: Base accuracy dropped to 48.2% ± 2.1%. Even with optimizations: Hard negative mining: 51.3% ± 1.8%, Temperature scaling: 50.7% ± 1.9%.  

Error analysis revealed systematic challenges in distinguishing closely related cell types. T cell subtype confusion remained particularly problematic: CD4+ vs CD8+: 72% confusion, Naive vs Memory: 81% confusion, Regulatory vs Helper: 68% confusion. Similar patterns emerged in myeloid populations: Monocyte vs Macrophage: 64% confusion, DC subtype mixing: 59% confusion. The OptimizedCLIPModule showed improved but still insufficient differentiation between these closely related states, suggesting fundamental limitations in using X_diffmap alone for cell state representation. Loss function experimentation provided incremental improvements: Standard InfoNCE (base): 56.4% Label smoothing (0.1): 57.1% Hard negative mining: 58.3% Supervised contrastive: 57.9% Training dynamics analysis revealed consistent patterns across both architectures, with base model training loss progressing from 2.47 → 0.89 and validation loss from 2.51 → 1.12. The optimized model showed improved convergence (training: 2.31 → 0.76, validation: 2.42 → 0.98). 

Critical examination of embedding spaces revealed persistent challenges across both architectures. The base DiffMapProteinCLIP showed significant embedding collapse among related cell types, with average cosine similarities remaining troublingly high: T cell subtypes (0.92), B cell developmental stages (0.89), and myeloid subtypes (0.85). The OptimizedCLIPModule, despite its enhanced architecture, only marginally improved these separation metrics (0.87, 0.84, and 0.81 respectively). 

Data augmentation strategies were systematically evaluated but showed limited impact. Gaussian noise (σ=0.1) achieved 55.8%, while dropout (p=0.2) and feature masking reached 56.1% and 54.9% respectively. The OptimizedCLIPModule showed slightly better resilience to augmentation, but improvements remained marginal (57.2%, 57.4%, and 56.8% respectively). Temperature scaling experiments revealed interesting dynamics: The base model showed peak performance at τ = 0.07 (56.4%), while learned temperature approaches reached 57.9%. The OptimizedCLIPModule's adaptive temperature scaling, combined with cache-based hard negative mining, pushed performance to 58.8%, though this improvement didn't translate to better fine-grained cell type discrimination.

The initial implementation phase spanned three intensive weeks, beginning with data processing, followed by model implementation, initial training cycles, and basic evaluation. The optimization phase extended over 4 weeks, encompassing architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, error analysis, and cross-dataset validation. Throughout this period, both the base DiffMapProteinCLIP and OptimizedCLIPModule were developed and refined in parallel.Marker gene space analysis revealed a critical insight: while hierarchical markers showed good separation (e.g., CD3 vs CD19 embedding cosine similarity of 0.23), subtype-specific markers remained heavily entangled in the learned space (CD4 vs CD8 similarity of 0.78). This pattern persisted across both architectures, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the current approach to cell state representation. 

Based on these comprehensive findings, a data representation revamp is proposed: 

Week 1-2 will focus on fundamental data enhancement: 

Implementing transcriptome embeddings alongside X_diffmap (SCVI like) 

Developing multi-anchor pseudotime calculations (dpt pseudotime) 

Establishing PAGA graph representations with validated topology 

Week 3-4 will concentrate on integration and validation: 

Computing branching probabilities with confidence metrics 

Building a unified feature normalization pipeline 

Initial quality assessment of integrated features 

Week 5 (if needed) will focus on refinement: 

Fine-tuning feature integration weights 

Comprehensive embedding quality analysis 

Start training again with both base and optimized architectures 

Cross-validation of embedding stability 

Key failure modes identified through this extensive testing point to five critical areas: 

Pure X_diffmap proves insufficient for capturing cellular hierarchy nuances 

Loss convergence masks fundamental embedding quality issues 

Current representations fail to maintain distinction between related cell states 

Cross-dataset generalization shows concerning degradation 

Marker gene relationships lack proper hierarchical encoding
